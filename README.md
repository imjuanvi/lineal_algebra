### Lineal Algebra

## 1. Inverse Matrix

- For the **code** please refer to `inverse_matrix.py`
- In this script the inverse of a matrix of order n is calculated.
- **Given key matrix**: X = [[2,0,1],[1,1,-4],[3,7,-3]]

## 2. Diagonal Matrix and Eigen Values/Vectors

- For the **code** please refer to `diagonalization.py`
- The documentation in the pdf is not updated yet
- **Given key matrix**: X = [[3,-2,-1],[2,-7,-7],[-2,10,10]]

## 3. Least Squares

- Still working on it

### Lineal Algebra

For now, the codes are written with a **Given key matrix**, in a future I will add the option to customize this without the need of changing in the scripts the number of loops, the matrix itself, etc. But for now I put the 3x3 matrix to test if the script works :)

## 1. Inverse Matrix

- For the **code** please refer to `inverse_matrix.py`
- In this script the inverse of a matrix of order n is calculated.
- **Given key matrix**: X = [[2,0,1],[1,1,-4],[3,7,-3]]

## 2. Diagonal Matrix and Eigen Values/Vectors

- For the **code** please refer to `diagonalization.py`
- The documentation in the pdf is not updated yet
- In this script the inverse of a matrix of order 3 is calculated.
- **Given key matrix**: X = [[3,-2,-1],[2,-7,-7],[-2,10,10]]

## 3. Least Squares

- Still working on it

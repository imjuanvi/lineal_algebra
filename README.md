### Lineal Algebra

For now, the codes are written with a **Given key matrix**, in a future I will add the option to customize this without the need of changing in the scripts the number of loops, the matrix itself, etc. But for now I put the 3x3 matrix to test if the script works :)

## 1. Inverse Matrix

- For the **code** please refer to `inverse_matrix.py`
- In this script the inverse of a matrix of order n is calculated.
- **Given key matrix**: X = [[2,0,1],[1,1,-4],[3,7,-3]]

## 2. Diagonal Matrix and Eigen Values/Vectors

- For the **code** please refer to `diagonalization.py`
- The documentation in the pdf is not updated yet
- In this script the inverse of a matrix of order 3 is calculated.
- **Given key matrix**: X = [[3,-2,-1],[2,-7,-7],[-2,10,10]]

## 3. Least Squares

- For the **code** please refer to `least-squares.py`
- The documentation in the pdf is not updated yet (I will complete this tomorrow 10/08/2022)
- The data we will use is from the file 'student-mat.csv' ; We will compare the grades from first period to the final grades and see if there's a correlation
- For linear regression I will upload an explanatory paper later and we will see if there is correlation by hypothesis testing, but for now in the algebra section it will serve as an explanation of least squares.
